This repository holds [default community health files](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file). Default community health files are used for repositories that do not contain its own file of that type. 

Individual repositories are free to override any community health file which is inherited from here. For example, if your team prefers a modified Pull Request Template, one specified in your project's root directory will override the template located in this repo.
